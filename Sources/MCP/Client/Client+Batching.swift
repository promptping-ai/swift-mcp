    /// This method allows you to group multiple MCP requests together,
    /// which are then sent to the server as a single JSON array.
    /// The server processes these requests and sends back a corresponding
    /// JSON array of responses.
    ///
    /// Within the `body` closure, use the provided `Batch` actor to add
    /// requests using `batch.addRequest(_:)`. Each call to `addRequest`
    /// returns a `Task` handle representing the asynchronous operation
    /// for that specific request's result.
    ///
    /// It's recommended to collect these `Task` handles into an array
    /// within the `body` closure`. After the `withBatch` method returns
    /// (meaning the batch request has been sent), you can then process
    /// the results by awaiting each `Task` in the collected array.
    ///
    /// Example 1: Batching multiple tool calls and collecting typed tasks:
    /// ```swift
    /// // Array to hold the task handles for each tool call
    /// var toolTasks: [Task<CallTool.Result, Error>] = []
    /// try await client.withBatch { batch in
    ///     for i in 0..<10 {
    ///         toolTasks.append(
    ///             try await batch.addRequest(
    ///                 CallTool.request(.init(name: "square", arguments: ["n": i]))
    ///             )
    ///         )
    ///     }
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Process results after the batch is sent
    /// print("Processing \(toolTasks.count) tool results...")
    /// for (index, task) in toolTasks.enumerated() {
    ///     do {
    ///         let result = try await task.value
    ///         print("\(index): \(result.content)")
    ///     } catch {
    ///         print("\(index) failed: \(error)")
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Example 2: Batching different request types and awaiting individual tasks:
    /// ```swift
    /// // Declare optional task variables beforehand
    /// var pingTask: Task<Ping.Result, Error>?
    /// var promptTask: Task<GetPrompt.Result, Error>?
    ///
    /// try await client.withBatch { batch in
    ///     // Assign the tasks within the batch closure
    ///     pingTask = try await batch.addRequest(Ping.request())
    ///     promptTask = try await batch.addRequest(GetPrompt.request(.init(name: "greeting")))
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Await the results after the batch is sent
    /// do {
    ///     if let pingTask {
    ///         try await pingTask.value // Await ping result (throws if ping failed)
    ///         print("Ping successful")
