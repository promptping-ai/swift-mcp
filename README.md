[**Documentation**](https://swiftpackageindex.com/DePasqualeOrg/mcp-swift-sdk/main/documentation/mcp)

This repository, which builds on the [official](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) but incomplete Swift SDK for MCP, includes functionality that has not yet been fully vetted. Feedback on anything that can be improved is welcome.

All of the functionality from protocol version 2025-11-25 has been implemented here, except for:

- JSON schema validation
- OAuth

This repository also resolves [bugs and spec compliance issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk/pull/175#issuecomment-3718183682) in the official SDK.
