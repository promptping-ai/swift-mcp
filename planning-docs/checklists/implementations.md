Thoroughly compare the Server metadata functionality in Swift to the MCP spec (2025-11-25) and the Python and TypeScript SDKs, and fill in any gaps or fix any mistakes you find in Swift. Swift needs to closely adhere to the spec and align with the Python and TypeScript implementations. Ensure that our Swift implementation is complete and accurate.
