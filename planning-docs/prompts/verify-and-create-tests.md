Check the integration/roundrtip tests in Swift and compare them to the relevant parts of the MCP spec and the tests in the Python and TypeScript SDKs. Do our Swift tests cover everything that's covered in the relevant Python and TypeScript tests? If not, add the missing tests based on the tests in Python and TypeScript. For any tests that you add, make sure that they are real, valuable tests and not fake or useless tests.
